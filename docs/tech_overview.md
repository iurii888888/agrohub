# Technical Overview

Smart Agro Hub is architected as a modular, scalable AI platform:

## 1. Data Collection Layer
- **Hardware:** Multispectral (NIR, Red, Green, Blue) cameras and commodity RGB cameras; environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, soil moisture, light intensity); livestock monitoring via weight scales and accelerometers.
- **Protocols:** MQTT (over TLS) for lightweight, low-latency edge communication; HTTPS/REST for bulk uploads; data batching for offline scenarios.

## 2. Processing Layer
- **Data Ingestion:** FastAPI microservice that authenticates devices, validates schema, and streams to Kafka topics.
- **Preprocessing Pipeline:** Dockerized tasks for:
  - **Image Processing:** OpenCV for resizing, normalization, NDVI computation.
  - **Time-Series Alignment:** Pandas for timestamp synchronization, missing value imputation, outlier detection.
  - **Enrichment:** Adds metadata (geolocation, device ID, timestamp) and stores raw inputs in S3-compatible storage.

## 3. AI Services
- **Computer Vision Module**
  - **Model Architecture:** Ensemble of EfficientNet-L2 and Vision Transformers, pretrained on PlantVillage and fine-tuned on a 100k+ image dataset of Cannabis and livestock postures.
  - **Serving:** TorchServe with GPU acceleration; autoscaling endpoints based on load.
- **Sensor Fusion Engine**
  - **Normalization:** MinMaxScaler/StandardScaler pipelines.
  - **Composite Scoring:** Weighted aggregation of environmental metrics, anomaly detection via isolation forests.
- **NLP Assist Module**
  - **RAG Architecture:** FAISS vector store for embedding-based retrieval from domain knowledge base; GPT-4 for response generation.
  - **Session Management:** Stateful context windows, custom prompt templates, and RLHF-refined responses for high accuracy.
- **Analytics & Trends**
  - **Time-Series Forecasting:** Prophet or ARIMA models for predicting environmental parameter drift.
  - **Alerting:** Threshold-based and ML-driven alerts, with customizable user rules.

## 4. Application Layer
- **Desktop Client (Electron + React):** Offline-first design using IndexedDB; ONNX-runtime for CV inference; secure local storage.
- **Web Dashboard (Next.js):** Real-time data visualization with D3.js; user authentication via Auth0; role-based access.
- **APIs:** RESTful endpoints secured with OAuth2 and JWT; GraphQL gateway for efficient data queries.
- **UX/UI:** Clean, responsive design; dark/light themes; accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant).

## Cross-Cutting Concerns
- **Security:** TLS for all transport; encryption at rest; audit logs via ELK stack.
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus for metrics; Grafana dashboards; alerting to Slack/email.
- **DevOps:** GitHub Actions CI/CD, Helm charts for deployments, automated rollback on failures.
- **Documentation & Testing:** Swagger/OpenAPI specs; unit/integration tests with pytest; end-to-end tests with Cypress.
