# Case Study: Livestock Monitoring

**Background:** A dairy farm with 200 cows reported 8% drop in milk production linked to heat stress.

**Solution Workflow:**
1. **Data Collection:** Wearable sensors captured body temp and activity; average temp was 39.5°C.
2. **CV Monitoring:** Vision module detected increased panting behavior in 35% of herd.
3. **Intervention:** Installed cooling fans and adjusted feeding times; provided electrolyte mix.
4. **Follow-up:** Monitored reduction in heat stress indicators via API; body temp normalized to 38.7°C.

**Results:** Milk production increased by 10%, mastitis cases reduced by 20%, and animal welfare scores improved by 30%.
