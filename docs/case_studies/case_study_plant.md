# Case Study: Plant Health Intervention

**Background:** A medium-sized indoor cannabis farm experienced recurring nitrogen deficiency, leading to 15% yield loss over two cycles.

**Solution Workflow:**
1. **Baseline Scan:** Collected 500 multispectral images; CV module identified deficiency in 48% of samples.
2. **Sensor Analysis:** Soil moisture at 30% below optimal; pH at 5.2 causing lockout.
3. **Recommendation:** Applied 25g/L nitrogen supplement and adjusted pH to 6.2.
4. **Monitoring:** Weekly follow-ups via API; NDVI index increased from 0.42 to 0.68 in 14 days.

**Results:** Yield improved by 18%, crop quality ratings increased by 12%, and nitrogen use efficiency improved by 25%.
