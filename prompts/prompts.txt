# Advanced GPT Prompts for Smart Agro Hub

1. Multi-modal Plant Diagnosis Prompt:
"Given a plant leaf image file and the following environmental sensor data:
- Temperature: {temperature} °C
- Humidity: {humidity} %
- Soil Moisture: {soil_moisture} %
- Light Intensity: {light} lux

Perform the following tasks:
a) Identify any diseases or nutrient deficiencies with both common and scientific names.
b) Provide probability estimates (0–100%) for each detected condition.
c) Recommend a treatment protocol, including fertilizer types, dosages (e.g., grams per liter), pH adjustments, and application schedules.
d) Outline a monitoring plan with key metrics and sampling frequency.
e) Cite at least two authoritative sources (academic papers or agronomic guidelines) to support each recommendation."

2. Livestock Condition & Nutrition Prompt:
"Analyze the livestock health metrics:
- Weight: {weight} kg
- Body Temperature: {body_temp} °C
- Heart Rate: {heart_rate} bpm
- Activity Level Score: {activity_level} (0–1 scale)
- Recent Feed Intake Log: {feed_history}

Then:
a) Diagnose any potential health issues or stressors.
b) Calculate an optimized daily feed formulation, specifying ingredient quantities and nutritional breakdown (proteins, fats, fibers, vitamins, and minerals).
c) Propose an environmental or behavioral intervention (exercise regimen, shelter adjustments).
d) Estimate weight gain or production impact over the next 7 days.
e) Reference relevant veterinary or animal nutrition standards."

3. Predictive Alert Generation Prompt:
"Input: Time-series data of environmental sensors and animal pen conditions (last 72 hours).
Task:
a) Detect anomalies or trend deviations that may signal impending issues (e.g., disease onslaught, equipment malfunction).
b) Generate a ranked list of top three risks with risk probability scores.
c) Provide immediate corrective measures and longer-term preventive strategies.
d) Draft pseudocode illustrating how to implement continuous monitoring and automated alerts with threshold definitions."

4. Voice-Enabled Advisory Flow Prompt:
"As a voice-activated agritech assistant, design a multi-turn conversational flow for the user query: '{user_query}'. The flow must:
a) Ask clarifying questions to fill required slots (e.g., plant stage, observed symptom).
b) Include concise TTS prompts (<15 words each).
c) Define intents, slots, and fallback responses for when input is unclear.
d) Log user responses in a structured format for analytics.
e) Provide example utterances and expected system responses for at least three different plant disease scenarios."

5. Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge Prompt:
"Using a FAISS-backed vector database of domain documents (NDVI studies, soil amendment protocols, livestock care manuals):
a) Retrieve the top 3 documents relevant to the query: '{query}'.
b) Extract and synthesize key findings applicable to the user's context.
c) Present a step-by-step action plan.
d) Embed APA-style citations for each fact."

6. Sensor Calibration & Validation Prompt:
"Given raw sensor calibration readings and ground truth measurements:
a) Derive a calibration curve equation.
b) Outline validation steps comparing sensor output to laboratory standards.
c) Provide a Python code snippet that applies calibration in real-time to sensor data streams."
